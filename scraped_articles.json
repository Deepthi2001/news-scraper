          "text": "Trump told Israel not to kill Iran's supreme leader - report\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News, Netanyahu did not directly confirm or deny a report from Reuters that Trump had vetoed a plan to kill the ayatollah.\n\nThe conversation is said to have happened since Israel launched its attack on Iran on Friday.\n\nTrump reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that assassinating Khamenei was \"not a good idea\", according to one official. The president has not commented publicly on the report.\n\nUS President Donald Trump rejected a plan by Israel to kill Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, three US officials have told BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\n\"There's so many false reports of conversations that never happened and I'm not going to get into that,\" the Israeli prime minister said.\n\n\"But I can tell you I think we do what we need to do. We will do what we need to do and I think the United States knows what is good for the United States and I'm just not going to get into it.\"\n\nAn Israeli official told CBS News that \"in principle\" Israel does not \"kill political leaders, we are focused on nuclear and military. I don't think anyone making decisions about those programs should be living free and easy\".\n\nIsrael first launched an attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure and other targets on Friday. The two countries have continued to launch massive strikes at each other since, with attacks entering a third day on Sunday.\n\nIn his latest post on Truth Social about the escalating situation in the Middle East, Trump said \"Iran and Israel should make a deal\", adding that he would get the two to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan\" - referring to the recent confrontation between the countries.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving for the G7 summit in Canada, Trump said the US would continue to support Israel and declined to say if he had asked the country to stop its strikes on Iran.\n\nThe next round of US-Iran nuclear talks were initially scheduled to take place on Sunday, but mediator, Oman's foreign minister Badr Albusaidi, announced a day earlier that they had been cancelled.\n\nIran told Qatar and Oman that it was not open to negotiating a ceasefire while it was still under Israeli attack, an official briefed on the communications told the Reuters news agency on Sunday.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US \"had nothing to do with the attack on Iran\".\n\n\"If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,\" he warned."

          "title": "'Nowhere feels safe': Iranians on life under Israeli attacks",
          "text": "'Nowhere feels safe': Iranians on life under Israeli attacks\n\n\"Stuck\". That is the word most people who have spoken to the BBC use to describe life in Iran right now.\n\nAfter three days of Israeli attacks, \"everyone is trying to escape\" Tehran \"one way or another,\" one resident told BBC News Persian.\n\nOn Sunday, long queues formed at petrol stations across the city. Many people tried to leave for remote areas, away from any possible Israeli target, but could not even get out of the province because of heavy traffic.\n\n\"Tehran isn't safe, clearly,\" one resident said. \"We get no alarms or warnings from officials about Israeli attacks. We just hear the blasts and hope our place isn't hit. But where can we go? Nowhere feels safe.\"\n\nOne person who managed to move from Tehran to another province said: \"I don't think I've fully processed that I'm living in an active war zone, and I'm not sure when I'll reach acceptance.\"\n\n\"This is not my war. I'm not rooting for either side, I just want to survive along with my family.\"\n\nSince Friday, Israel hit Iran with its biggest wave of air strikes in years.\n\nIsrael's strikes have led to retaliation from Iran, which has launched missile attacks on Israel.\n\nAt least 10 people have been killed in Israel, authorities said. Iranian media, citing the health ministry, reported that 128 people had been killed in Israeli attacks as of midday on Saturday.\n\nOne Iranian told the BBC she has not been able to sleep for two nights: \"I've gone through really tough situations.\"\n\nShe said the current situation reminds her of bombings and going to shelters during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, when she was a child.\n\n\"The difference is that back then, at least when an attack happened, we heard the air raid siren or at least warnings before it happened. But now, during this bombing or any air raid, there's no sirens or warnings.\"\n\nYounger people, born after the war, do not know what it was like, BBC News Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad said.\n\nOne woman in Tehran said she has considered leaving the city to escape the attacks.\n\n\"We've all wanted to go to smaller cities or villages, anywhere we can go, but each of us has loved ones who can't leave, and we're thinking of them,\" she said. \"What we're experiencing is not fair to any of us, the people of Iran.\"\n\n\"We're all trying to get through these days in fear, exhaustion, and a lot of stress, this is extremely hard and painful.\"\n\nOne resident in the capital said: \"I can't just leave Tehran. I can't leave my elderly parents who can't travel far and long and leave the city myself. Besides, I need to show up to work. What can I do now?\""

          "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFor all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs\u2019 tweets.\n\nThe wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\n\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is \u201cCRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.\u201d\n\nAt trial, it will be a jury\u2019s job to determine if the statements were made with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2013 a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth \u2013 and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn\u2019t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n\nBroadcast 1: Bartiromo interviews Powell\n\nMaria Bartiromo is involved in three broadcasts that Dominion says were defamatory.

I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,\u201d Bartiromo said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.\u201d\n\nBroadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani\n\nThe broadcast: \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d on November 12, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: \u201cSo, we\u2019re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to \u2013 were close to (Hugo) Ch\u00e1vez, are now close to (Nicol\u00e1s) Maduro, have a history.

          "text": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN \u2014\n\nFox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network\u2019s credibility.\n\nFox News\u2019 $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\n\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\n\nAttorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP\n\n\u201cThe parties have resolved their case,\u201d Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media \u201ctrial of the century\u201d before it could even begin.\n\nThe groundbreaking settlement \u201crepresents vindication and accountability,\u201d Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. \u201cFor our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts\u2026 Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it \u201cacknowledge[s] the Court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\u201d referring to Davis\u2019 recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won\u2019t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\n\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company\u2019s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\n\nFox avoids painful six-week trial\n\nThe last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won\u2019t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\n\nFox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. April 18, 2023. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nThe witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\n\nRupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was \u201creally crazy,\u201d even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he \u201cpassionately\u201d hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were \u201ckooky,\u201d \u201cdangerously reckless\u201d and \u201cmind-blowingly nuts.\u201d\n\nThese revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n\n\u201cThis settlement reflects Fox\u2019s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,\u201d Fox said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\u201d\n\nFox News and Fox Corporation \u2013 its parent company, which was also a defendant \u2013 maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\n\nDramatic days in Delaware\n\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\n\nThe jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn\u2019t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\n\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n\n\u201cYour presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWithout you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.\u201d\n\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n\n\u201cFox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,\u201d Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\n\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News\u2019 shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn\u2019t expected anytime soon.\n\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liam Reilly and Danny Freeman contributed to this story."

          "text": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has argued that the attack on Iran was to stop Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, even as a sixth round of talks to prevent that very outcome was scheduled between the United States and Iran.\n\nWhile Israel argues that it had to strike now to prevent an Iranian race to bomb, American and European judgments were that Iran was still many months away from building a bomb and has not yet decided to do so.\n\nMr. Netanyahu believes that a deal that would allow Iran to enrich uranium would mean a nuclear-armed Iran in the future, and he has been bent on preventing that outcome. He has apparently judged that a U.S.-Iran deal would have kept him from his goal of destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and, perhaps, he hopes, bringing about the fall of the Islamic Republic.\n\nBut Israel is considered highly unlikely to meet the goal of destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program without active American involvement, which Mr. Trump has so far resisted.\n\nThe president continues to say that he wants negotiations to succeed. He seems to believe that the attack will bring Iran back to the table in a weaker and more conciliatory position, ready to accept his latest demand that it halt all enrichment of uranium. But Iran insists that it has the right to enrich for civilian uses under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n\nMr. Trump clearly sees the war as a form of diplomacy. On Friday, he wrote: \u201cTwo months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to \u2018make a deal.\u2019 They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn\u2019t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\u201d\n\nEarly on Sunday, Mr. Trump warned Iran against attacking American forces in a message on Truth Social. \u201cHowever, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict,\u201d he said. Whether Israel would accept such a deal, if Iran is allowed to enrich at all, is an open question.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump, who has said he knew about the Israeli attack beforehand, has done nothing in public to restrain the Israelis. When Washington announced last week that the talks would continue on Sunday, it is not clear whether it knew when Israel would attack, but the Iranians are convinced that Washington was complicit in trying to fool them into believing that any Israeli attack would come afterward.\n\nA quick deal now that would give up enrichment would be seen as a surrender, said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who served in the State Department during the Obama administration. That could make the Iranian government more vulnerable at home. \u201cThey won\u2019t give up enrichment, not this easily,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to surrender.\u201d"

          "text": "American consumers are likely to start feeling the impact of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, as more expensive oil causes prices at the gas pump to rise.\n\nU.S. oil prices climbed about 3 percent as markets opened on Sunday evening, hovering around $75 a barrel, after Israel struck several Iranian oil and gas facilities over the weekend. Those included one of the world\u2019s largest natural gas fields, known as South Pars; Tehran\u2019s main gas depot; and an oil refinery.\n\nBut the strikes have not yet meaningfully affected the flow of oil in the region, which is a key energy transit hub, said Tom Kloza, chief market analyst for Turner, Mason & Company, an energy consulting firm.\n\nSunday\u2019s price movement added to a 12 percent gain in oil prices from Monday to Friday. Last week\u2019s price increase alone could cause gasoline prices to rise about 20 cents a gallon in the coming weeks, according to ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm."

          "text": "When an assassin visited the homes of two Minnesota lawmakers on Saturday, it exposed the longstanding tension between a public official\u2019s accessibility and their security.\n\nBoth State Representative Melissa Hortman, who along with her husband Mark was killed, and State Senator John A. Hoffman, who along with his wife Yvette was wounded, readily shared their home addresses with constituents. Ms. Hortman\u2019s address was listed on her campaign website, and Mr. Hoffman\u2019s address had been listed on his official legislative webpage, a common practice in many states.\n\nBut in the hours after the shootings, while police officers were still searching for the assassin, lawmakers across the country began to rethink their approach to privacy and safety. The Michigan State Police held security briefings for legislators. The police in Fairfax County, Va., increased patrols around lawmakers\u2019 homes. And in North Dakota, officials decided by midday Saturday to scrub home addresses from legislator biography pages.\n\n\u201cIn light of the tragedy in Minnesota, we quickly decided to remove all addresses until our leaders have time to assess the proper balance between transparency and safety of our elected officials,\u201d John D. Bjornson, the director of the North Dakota Legislative Council, said in an email.\n\nIn interviews with lawmakers across the country, some said sharing their home address helped reassure constituents that they were part of the community and could be easily reached. But unlike governors and presidents, most state lawmakers have no special security protection when they are away from work. The country\u2019s coarsening public discourse has left them to weigh difficult trade-offs.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why my address is easily found is to make it clear that I actually live in my district,\u201d said Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, a Democratic state representative in Kansas. \u201cIf you have a P.O. box, you don\u2019t look authentic, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for authenticity,\u201d Ms. Clayton added, \u201cyou kind of pay that price of vulnerability.\u201d\n\nThough recent political violence has cut across party lines, both Minnesota lawmakers who were shot were Democrats, and the suspected assassin was said to be carrying a list of targets that was filled with more Democrats.\n\nIn Ohio, State Senator Casey Weinstein thanked his state\u2019s Republican governor on Saturday for increasing security for lawmakers, a decision that the governor\u2019s office declined to confirm.\n\n\u201cHonestly I\u2019m struggling with this news,\u201d Mr. Weinstein, a Democrat, wrote on Facebook after the Minnesota attacks. \u201cI\u2019m worried for my family. I worry I\u2019m putting them in harm\u2019s way by being in office. It\u2019s a terrible feeling.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, State Representative Karen Whitsett said she had no plans to remove her home address from her campaign website. Having it there, she said, showed constituents in her Detroit-based district that \u201cI\u2019m right here, I\u2019m with you\u201d and \u201cthat I\u2019m not disconnected.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Whitsett, a Democrat who sometimes votes with Republicans in her state\u2019s closely divided Legislature, said she had faced threats over the years.\n\nAfter the Minnesota attack, Ms. Whitsett said she decided to seek a permit to carry a concealed gun. Ms. Whitsett said she previously had such a permit and used it to carry a weapon inside the State Capitol, where she does not always feel safe. She plans to do so again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to depend on security,\u201d said Ms. Whitsett, who on Sunday attended a video briefing on legislator safety that the Michigan State Police scheduled after the Minnesota attacks.\n\nAnother Michigan state representative, Bill G. Schuette, a Republican, said he had purchased a home security system in recent years after angry people showed up at his house on multiple occasions. His address, he said, was required to be public under state law.\n\n\u201cYou sign up in this business to be accessible to your constituents and to be a voice that\u2019s always listening,\u201d Mr. Schuette said. \u201cYou really have to be grateful and thankful for our brave women and men in law enforcement, and hopeful, too, that people will try and respect some personal boundaries.\u201d\n\nLawmakers, of course, are hardly alone in having personal information widely exposed online, and even legislators who do not actively publish their addresses might be easily found with a quick Google search.\n\nSome legislators also bristled at the idea that they might receive extra protections. In Michigan, Ms. Whitsett said many of her constituents live with a daily threat of violence that politicians have not done enough to address. And in Kansas, Ms. Clayton said that \u201cI am no different or no more special than any other constituent of mine who goes to work and faces the risk of getting hurt or killed on the job.\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers want to limit what personal information is available about them, there are limiting factors. Some campaign finance forms and other public documents list politicians\u2019 addresses and phone numbers. And because elected officials must generally live in the districts they represent, there is a level of accountability in the public knowing where a lawmaker claims to live.\n\nIn North Dakota, State Senator Ryan Braunberger said he had been comfortable with his address being posted online before state officials decided to take it down this weekend. Mr. Braunberger, the Democratic leader in his chamber, said he had heard from the police in his home city of Fargo that they would be increasing patrols near legislators\u2019 homes following the shootings near Minneapolis, about three hours away by car.\n\n\u201cHonestly I don\u2019t feel unsafe today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also refuse to live in that world of fear, because it only encourages the perpetrators. Because that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do, is incite fear.\u201d"
